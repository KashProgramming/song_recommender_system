# Song Recommender System ðŸŽµ

A hybrid music recommendation system that combines constraint-based filtering with content-based similarity to suggest songs based on your preferences.

**Live Demo:** [Song Recommender System](https://songrecommendersystem-production.up.railway.app)

---

## Features
- **Content-Based Recommendations:** Find similar songs based on audio features (danceability, energy, tempo, etc.)
- **Constraint Filtering:** Filter by genre, popularity, tempo, acousticness, and more
- **Hybrid Scoring:** Combines similarity, genre matching, and popularity for better results
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Easy-to-use form with real-time recommendations

---

## How It Works
1. **Enter songs you like** (optional) - The system finds similar tracks
2. **Set your preferences** - Filter by genre, tempo, popularity, etc.
3. **Get recommendations** - Receive personalized song suggestions with detailed info

### Recommendation Algorithm
```
User Input â†’ Constraint Filtering â†’ Content Similarity â†’ Hybrid Scoring â†’ Ranked Results
```
- **Constraint Layer:** Hard filters (genre, explicit, popularity ranges)
- **Content Layer:** Cosine similarity on 9 normalized audio features
- **Hybrid Layer:** Weighted scoring with genre boost and popularity

---

## Dataset
Uses a Spotify dataset with 10,000 tracks containing:
- Track metadata (name, artist, album, genre)
- Audio features (danceability, energy, valence, acousticness, etc.)
- Popularity metrics

---

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Flask, Python
- **ML Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Deployment:** Railway
